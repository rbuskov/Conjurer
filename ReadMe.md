Conjuror
========

Conjuror is a slightly warped .NET implementation of the [Test Data Builder](http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html) pattern that helps you set up objects in the arrange part of your tests. Although useful in a number of situations, Conjuror excels at setting up POCO style entity objects for applications that use Entity Framework, NHibernate and similar persistence frameworks.

Conjuror was designed for flexibility, terseness and minimal mental footprint - so if you find [AutoFixture](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture) too limiting and [NBuilder](http://nbuilder.org/) too verbose, Conjuror just might fit the bill. 

Abracadabra!
